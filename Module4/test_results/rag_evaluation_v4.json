Do not allow him to use playground equipment without an impact- absorbing surface underneath, such as wood chips, shredded rubber, sand, or rubber mats. Even with soft mats or chips, broken arms are extremely common in kids who fall off playground equipment, so watch carefully and keep your child at a reasonable height for getting off and landing. Do not go down slides with your child in your lap, as this is a common cause of broken bones.\n",
