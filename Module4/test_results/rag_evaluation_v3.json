    "question": "What safety precautions are recommended for playgrounds to prevent injuries from falls?",
    "predicted_answer": "During your child’s preschool years, you and your pediatrician should work together to ensure your child’s immunizations are up- to- date. Refer to the chart on page 893 for an overview of vaccines he should have received in the first three years. Watch your child on slides, swings, and monkey bars. Do not allow him to use playground equipment without an impact- absorbing surface underneath, such as wood chips, shredded rubber, sand, or rubber mats. Even with soft mats or chips, broken arms are extremely common in kids who fall off playground equipment, especially the monkey bars, so watch carefully and keep your child at a reasonable height for getting off and landing. Do not go down slides with your child in your lap, as this is a common cause of broken bones. Avoid unstable tricycles, and use the kind with a low-to-the-ground profile. Do not allow your child to ride in the street. Also, continue to use gates at the top and bottom of staircases. There should be a clear policy about illness among children. Children with fever should be excluded whenever the fever is accompanied by behavioral changes or symptoms that may need a doctor’s attention. At the same time, the presence of a fever alone should not keep a child from participating in childcare, since the fever itself isn’t particularly relevant to whether the disease will spread. Many childcare centers have fever rules that are stricter than these, often to comply with state or local regulations. Always supervise toddlers around animals, especially dogs.  Keep electrical outlets out of reach. Ensure that there is a clear policy about illness among children.  As your child gets older and more active, traveling may become more challenging. Your three-year-old will be restless when confined to a seat and, with his increasing willfulness, may protest loudly when you insist he stay put.  Consider engaging the rear door child safety lock.",
    "expected_answer": "Playground equipment should only be used if there is an impact-absorbing surface underneath, such as wood chips, sand, or rubber mats[cite: 733].

    "expected_answer": "For a non-verbal child, the adult should get down to eye level, maintain eye contact, and be present as the child makes sounds or expressions[cite: 3].
