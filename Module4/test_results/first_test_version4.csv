What safety precautions are recommended for playgrounds to prevent injuries from falls?,"During your child’s preschool years, you and your pediatrician should work together to ensure your child’s immunizations are up- to- date. Refer to the chart on page 893 for an overview of vaccines he should have received in the first three years. Watch your child on slides, swings, and monkey bars. Do not allow him to use playground equipment without an impact- absorbing surface underneath, such as wood chips, shredded rubber, sand, or rubber mats. Even with soft mats or chips, broken arms are extremely common in kids who fall off playground equipment, so watch carefully and keep your child at a reasonable height for getting off and landing. Do not go down slides with your child in your lap, as this is a common cause of broken bones.
