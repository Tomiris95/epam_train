# AI Glossary

1) Artificial Intelligence – machines or systems that can learn and make a decision like a human
2) Predictive maintenance – prediction of equipment failure based on the various sensors data
3) False positives/negatives – incorrect prediction of the machine learning model, i.e.  where the actual class is negative model predicts positive and where the actual class is positive model predicts negative
4) Conversational AI – artificial intelligent that can understand and generate human language, so it can chat with people 
5) Virtual assistant -  AI assistant that helps customer by answering questions and giving guidelines to perform some tasks
6) Automated routing – directing customer request to the right person, agent or system that can solve the issue
7) Large language model – is a big neural network that was trained on a huge amount of data and understand and generate human language
8) Machine learning – teaching computers on the data in order to make predictions and decisions
9) Computer Vision – artificial intelligent that can interpret, detect and analyze images and videos like human
10) Annotating data -  labeling dataset that will be used for training model
11) Deploying model – putting an AI model into production that it could work with real data 
12) Generalization – the ability of machine learning model perform well on new unseen data
13) Image classifier – AI model that assigns label to an image based on its characteristics
14) Object detection models – AI model that identifies multiple objects on image or video
15) AutoML – tools that automates machine learning workflow
16) Intelligent document processing – AI based methods that extract, interpret, process data from documents
17) Intelligent OCR - AI-powered Optical Character Recognition that reads, interprets, and extracts meaningful information from documents
18) Anomaly and fraud detection -  AI model that identifies unusual patterns in data
19) Imbalanced datasets – dataset that has a lot of samples of some classes, and a very few samples of other classes
20) Demand forecasting – predicting future demand for product or service based on historical data
21) Multi-horizon forecasting – predicting several future time points simultaneously
22) Overfitting  - situation when ML model works (predicts) very well on train data, but performs (predicts) poorly on new unseen data 
23) Time series forecasting - predicting future values based on previous (historical) values, for example predicting houses price for the next year based on the houses price of the last 5 years.
24) AI-driven personalization – providing personalized recommendations to customer using AI tools
25) Privacy/regulatory constraints – legal rules that protest personal data and regulates its usage
